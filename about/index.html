        The Cards Chess Club strives to develop friendships, strengthen bonds, 
        and most importantly have a good time! We exist not only for our love 
        of chess, but for our strive to learn from each others' differences. 
        I, Meli, as a prime representative of the Cards Chess Club, welcome anyone; 
        regardless of background and skill, to join us and strive to be a better person, 
        make cool new friends, and have fun along the way!
