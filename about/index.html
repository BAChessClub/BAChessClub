        The Cards Chess Club strives to develop friendships, strengthen bonds, 
        and most importantly have a good time! We exist not only for our love 
        of chess, but for our strive to learn from each others' differences. 
        I, Meli, as a prime representative of the Cards Chess Club, welcome anyone; 
        regardless of background and skill, to join us and strive to be a better person, 
        make cool new friends, and have fun along the way!
        <br><br>
        The <b>Cards Chess Club</b> was founded by Meli, alongside Gabe as not only a 
        place for chess lovers to unite, but also as a place for people to connect. 
        <br><br>
        Our mission as a club is to grow and create a community that both other people 
        enjoy being in, and other people can connect in. If you want to join our community, 
        see our <a href="/contact-us/" class="link">Contact Us Page</a>, and feel free to 
        join our Discord!
